//We are to make a program that tell us if the number the user inputs is even or odd. Add data validation and a playAgain feture.
//Peer Reivew: Freddy Aguilar

The program is intended to take the users input, any number they choose, and return whether it is an odd or even number. The progam does that, but it does not include data validation where is I enter a string instead of a number it allows it as an entry, turning out even. Likewise with the option to end program or continue. If I type end the progam ends as intended but if I input a number instead of a string it allows me to continue the program.
